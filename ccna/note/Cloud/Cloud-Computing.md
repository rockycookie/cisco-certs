# Cloud Computing

 
## NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) definition:
- On-demand self-service: The IT consumer chooses when to start and stop using the service, without any direct interaction with the provider of the service.
    - cloud services catalog
- Broad network access: The service must be available from many types of devices and over many types of networks (including the Internet).
- Resource pooling: The provider creates a pool of resources (rather than dedicating specific servers for use only by certain consumers) and dynamically allocates resources from that pool for each new request from a consumer.
- Rapid elasticity: To the consumer, the resource pool appears to be unlimited (that is, it expands quickly, so it is called elastic), and the requests for new service are filled quickly.
- Measured service: The provider can measure the usage and report that usage to the consumer, both for transparency and for billing.


## Private Cloud (On-Premise)
Private cloud creates a service, inside a company, to internal customers, that meets the five criteria from the NIST list.

## Public Cloud (Cloud)
A public cloud provider offers services, selling those services to consumers in other companies.
