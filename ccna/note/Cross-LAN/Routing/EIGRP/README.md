# EIGRP
- runs over IP using protocol number 88
- originally Cisco proprietary but became an open standard (RFC 7868) that can be implemented by any vendor
- support for unequal-cost load balancing
    - the variance command, allowing traffic to be distributed across multiple paths with different metrics
        - better vs to protocols that only support equal-cost load balancing
- use Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP)
    - ensure reliable delivery of routing updates to neighbors
        - with acknowledgment and retransmission
- use the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) for route computation
    - loop-free operation and rapid convergence
- use its own packet types for topology information sharing
    - Update, Query, and Reply packets for routing information exchange
    - different from Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)
- form neighbor relationships through a simple two-way Hello packet process
