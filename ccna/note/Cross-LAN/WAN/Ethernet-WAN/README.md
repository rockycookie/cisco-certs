# Ethernet WAN

- WAN links do use the same data-link protocols as Ethernet LANs, but they use additional features to make the links work over the much longer distances required for WANs
- L2 protocol: Ethernet
- For the first several decades of existence, Ethernet was only appropriate for LANs. The restrictions on cable lengths and devices might allow a LAN that stretched 1-2km, to support a campus LAN, but that was the limit.
- Fiber Ethernet links (up to 70km) made it available for WAN
- In reaclity, both endpoints connect to ISP's devices using Fiber links; for the exam, think there is a p2p fiber link connecting the two endpoints
