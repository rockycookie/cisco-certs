# Glass Fibers
To transmit between two devices, you need two cables, one for each direction.

## Components of a Fiber-Optic Cable

From core to outside:
1. Core         (function purpose)
2. Cladding     (function purpose)
3. Buffer       (protection purpose)
4. Strengthener (protection purpose)
5. Outer jacket (protection purpose)

## 2 types

### Multi-mode Fiber
- Transmitter: light emitting diode (LED)
- Cladding reflects the light back into the core as it travels through the core
- The cable allows for multiple angles (modes) of light waves entering the core

### Single-mode Fiber
- laser-based transmitter sending light at a single angle
- smaller-diameter (thinner) core
    - about 1/5 of multi-mode core
