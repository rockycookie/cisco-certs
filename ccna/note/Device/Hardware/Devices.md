## Bridge

### A bridge segments the LAN into separate collision domains
Note, a bridge usually connects two LAN segments, but could connect more. <br/>
The following topology has 5 collision domains, same as switches.

- root/cable
    - bridgeA
        - Hub1
        - Hub2
    - bridgeB
        - Hub3
        - Hub4
