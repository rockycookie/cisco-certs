# 2.4GHz vs 5GHz

|                                                              | 2.4 GHz                     | 5 GHz  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| non-overlapping channels                                     | more                        |        |
| transmission range length                                    | longer (better penetration) |        |
| potential data rates / speed                                 |                             | higher |
| interference by common devices (microwaves, Bluetooth, etc.) |                             | less   |
