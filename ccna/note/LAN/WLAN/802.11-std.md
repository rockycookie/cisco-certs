# 802.11 Standard
STA connecting to an open SSID. The summary of it all is as follows:
1. STA is unauthenticated and unassociated
2. STA becomes authenticated and unassociated
    - Auth here only means "you are a valid 802.11 device"
3. STA becomes authenticated and associated
4. STA clears security requirements such as 802.1X, if required

## Situation
- If multiple wireless signals are received at the same time, they can interfere with each other
    - To keep everything clean, only one device should transmit at any given time

## BSS (Basic Service Set)
The solution is to make every wireless service area a closed group of mobile devices that forms around an AP (access point, providing BSS over a single wireless channel);
before a device can participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join.

- basic service area (BSA) or cell --> area the AP can reach
- BSSID --> based on AP MAC
- Every communication goes through the AP
- Every associated device can see any packet sent to the AP

## DS (Distribution System)
- AP uplinks into an Ethernet network
- Wireless and wired frames are translated and then bridged at Layer 2
- Multiple VLANs are mapped to multiple SSIDs (BSSIDs would be different too) in the same AP

## ESS (Extended Service Set)
In an ESS, a wireless client can associate with one AP while it is physically located near that AP.
If the client later moves to a different location, it can associate with a different nearby  AP automatically

- each AP offers its own BSS on its own channel, to prevent interference between the APs.
- Same SSIDs but different BSSIDs
- Roaming:  Passing from one AP to another

## IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set)
- also known as an ad hoc wireless network
- allow two or more wireless clients to communicate directly with each other
- do not scale well beyond eight to ten devices
