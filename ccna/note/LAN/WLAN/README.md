## Other network topologies
- repeater
- WGB (workgroup bridge)
    - For devices can only use ethernet cable, but need wireless connection
- outdoor bridge
    - An AP can be configured to act as a bridge to form a single wireless link from one LAN to another over a long distance
    - commonly used for connectivity between buildings or between cities
    - A point-to-multipoint bridged link allows a central site to be bridged to several other sites.
- mesh network
    - In a mesh topology, wireless traffic is bridged from AP to AP, in a daisy-chain fashion, using another wireless channel.
    - e.g. many APs chained eventually conntected to one switch via one cable

## Radio Frequency
- Band
    - 2.4GHz
        - many overlapping channels
            - only 3 nonoverlapping channels are available
        - reach further
        - better penetration (walls)
    - 5GHz
        - no overlapping channel
            - many more than 3
        - less interference
