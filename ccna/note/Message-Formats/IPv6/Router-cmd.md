# Router commands

## Enale IPv6
On Cisco routers, IPv4 routing is enabled by default, but IPv6 routing is not enabled by default.
```
(config terminal)# ipv6 unicast-routing
```
- without this, router does not route IPv6 traffic
    - some links, particularly WAN links, do not need a global unicast address
    - use the `ipv6 enable` command, enabling IPv6 and giving each interface a generated link-local IPv6 address

## Address for interface
```
ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1111:1::1/64
```
or
```
ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 eui-64
```

## Verify address
```
R1# show ipv6 interface brief
```
