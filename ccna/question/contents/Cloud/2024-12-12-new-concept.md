### What option(s) are required criteria for a service to be a cloud service?
- [x] Rapid elasticity
- [ ] Agile network access
- [x] Measured service
- [ ] Proactive service

Five specific criteria are required for a service to be a cloud service:
- On-demand self-service: You determine when you want and do not want a service.
- Broad network access: The cloud service must be accessible by numerous connectivity options and a fast number of devices should be able to leverage it.
- Resource pooling: Instead of assigning dedicated resources, such as memory and CPU, to each system, resources can be shared across a set of services, servers, and systems. These shared resources are then dynamically allocated on-demand as a system needs it.
- Rapid elasticity: A cloud service is very different from an on-premise virtual environment. There are still capabilities like resource pooling on-premise, but with rapid elasticity itâ€™s hard to come by. Rapid elasticity makes the pools of resources seem unlimited. New resource requests are completed rapidly.
- Measured service: In a cloud service, utilization is tracked and monitored, which can then be reported on by the operator. This is used for billing but also can be used for other capabilities if needed by an organization.
