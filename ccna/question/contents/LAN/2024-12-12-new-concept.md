### What are common LAN Layer 1 problem indicators?
- [x] Collisions
- [ ] High-bandwidth utilization
- [x] Late collisions
- [ ] Incorrect IP addressing
- [ ] Incorrect VLAN assignments

Collisions and late collisions can be due to mismatched settings such as duplex on either side of the connection. A late collision in a half-duplex environment could be due to physical cable lengths being longer than the standard permits.
High-bandwidth utilization could be normal, based on the amount of traffic flowing through the network. Incorrect IP addressing would be a symptom of poor Layer 3 planning and implementation, and incorrect VLAN assignments would be poor Layer 2 implementation and/or planning.
