### Two switches are connected by four Fast Ethernet trunks. Four VLANs exist, with members of each VLAN on each of the two switches. The network engineer would like to have the switches treat all 4 trunks as a single 400 Mbps trunk, with some of the traffic being forwarded over each of the links between the switches. Which of the following statements are true of such a configuration?
- [x] The four trunks can be placed into the same EtherChannel to achieve this goal.
- [ ] STP can be used to cause balancing over three of the four trunks, blocking on one trunk to prevent loops
- [ ] The show spanning-tree command will list the combined four links with an abbreviation of EC for EtherChannel.
- [x] The show spanning-tree command will list the combined four links with an abbreviation of Po for PortChannel.
