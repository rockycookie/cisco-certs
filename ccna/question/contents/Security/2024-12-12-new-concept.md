### From the following spoofing attacks, which option(s) leverages an application, device, or service to increase the amount of traffic being sent toward a target?
- [ ] DoS/DDoS
- [ ] Reflection
- [x] Amplification
- [ ] Man-in-the-middle

In a reflection attack, the attacker sends packets with a spoofed source address toward a live host, but the host is not the intended target. The attacker’s goal is to get the host in question to send traffic to the spoofed address that is the actual target. <br/>
Another similar attack is called an amplification attack, which is a reflection attack that can leverage an application or device to increase the amount of traffic being sent toward a target, even when the attacker is originally sending a small amount of data. <br/>
In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker is able to get in the direct path of two or more devices sending traffic. Once in position, the attacker can relay requests and responses back and forth, completing the traffic patterns. The attacker can modify the requests and responses it receives to its own goals while still being hidden from detection. <br/>
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack’s goal is to reduce a system, service, application, device, or resource to the point that it can no longer function. In most cases the target is forced to complete an unplanned shutdown to mitigate the attack. <br/>
