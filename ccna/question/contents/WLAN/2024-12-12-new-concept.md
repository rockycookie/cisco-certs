### Of the different public cloud WAN options, which have quality of service capabilities to ensure end-to-end application requirements?

- [ ] Internet
- [x] Intercloud exchange
- [x] Ethernet WAN
- [x] MPLS VPN
- [ ] Internet VPN

Intercloud exchange, Ethernet WAN, and MPLS VPN all have capabilities that provide quality of service. The only options that do not inherently provide any quality of service capabilities are the Internet and Internet VPN. Keep in mind that once your traffic leaves your perimeter into the Internet it is no longer under your control, and you cannot guarantee any QoS requirements.
